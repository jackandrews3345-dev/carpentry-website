### STEP 2: Enable Email (10 minutes) ⚠️ IMPORTANT!

**Quick Version:**
1. Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) and sign up (FREE)

3. Copy your Form ID (looks like: `xeqyabcd`)
4. Open file: `assets/js/email-integration.js`
5. Line 8: Replace `YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID_HERE` with your actual Form ID
